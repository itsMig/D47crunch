# D47crunch

Python library designed to process and standardize carbonate clumped-isotope
analyses, from low-level data out of a dual-inlet mass spectrometer to final,
“absolute” Δ47 values with fully propagated analytical error estimates.

All questions and suggestions are welcome and should be directed at [Mathieu Daëron](mailto:mathieu@daeron.fr?subject=[D47crunch]).

## Installation

This should do the trick: `pip install D47crunch`
